            <h2>They were never there.</h2>
            <p>Mrs. Paterson, standing by the stove, glanced over her shoulder. The smell of sizzling bacon and fresh toast filled the air. “Oh? Another one of those spooky stories?” she asked with a soft smile, her hands busy plating up breakfast. “Oh, by the way, the coffee machine is broken so you have to buy some on your way.”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, I sure will.” Mr. Paterson replied, shaking his head. “Apparently, there have been “sightings” again, right here in Raven’s Veil.” He chuckled, folding the paper and setting it aside.[While imperceptible to Mrs. Paterson, Mr. Paterson’s pulse quietly quickened to rapid 120 bpm.]  </p>
            <p>Mrs. Paterson joined him at the table, carefully placing the plates down. She leaned over slightly, scanning the headline. “Well, I guess people are still wondering about that old rumor.” she said, her voice trailing off thoughtfully.</p>
            <p>The Patersons were living at 4932, 001, Ave in Raven's Veil, an unsettling little town. Some years ago, there had been a rumor about a murder there, but it was mostly dismissed as myth.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paterson worked a desk job, and they were a wealthy family. They had a son named Greg, who was a kind child. However, from the moment he could talk, he would often mutter to himself. Nobody ever knew what he was saying.</p>
            <p>Our story begins on a Monday morning when Mr. Paterson told Mrs. Paterson about reported ghost sightings he had read about in the newspaper. The smell of bacon caught Greg’s attention, and he came running into the kitchen. It was his first day of school, and he was bursting with excitement.</p>
            <p>“Now Greg,” Mr. Paterson said, “what did we discuss last night about going to school?”
                “Don’t pull other kids' hair, don’t mutter, and uhh…” Greg replied.
                “And?”
                “Don’t hurt them?”
                “Yes, very good, Greg. Now remember to have fun and respect everyone, okay?”
                “...”
                “I have to go to work now. Love you.”</p>
                <p>With that, Mr. Paterson finished his breakfast, kissed Mrs. Paterson, and headed out the door.</p>
                <p>He drove along Watson Way, thinking he was on his usual route to work. Suddenly, the coffee withdrawal hit him—a dull, throbbing ache. Giving him a painful reminder about his lack of coffee. He headed straight for the shop but made a wrong turn and ended up in an alleyway. Even with the sun, it seemed very little light could penetrate the copious high rises and skyscrapers.While backing out, he noticed a strange boy who looked eerily similar to his own son—except this boy had something around his mouth, a deep crimson something. Startled, he quickly reversed out of the alley and went to buy coffee. He tried to calm himself as he gulped down his coffee. He cautiously drove to work.</p>
                <p>Throughout the day, he couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling that something bad was going to happen.
                “It’s okay,” he thought. “It’s probably just because Halloween is near, and I’m a little jumpy.”</p>
                <p>Even so, it didn’t make sense to him why he’d be so scared by the idea of ghosts.</p>
                <p>When Mr. Paterson arrived home that evening, he walked along the well-paved pathway and noticed a storm brewing on the horizon. The unease in his chest grew stronger, bursting through his chest. He unlocked the front door and stumbled inside.</p>
                <p>His wife had not come home from work, and Greg was in his room playing with a set of toy trains. He quickly put little Greg to bed, turned off his lights and closed the door. He began  to feel very tired, very quickly and collapsed on the couch.</p>
                <p>He must have dozed off, because he was jolted awake by a piercing scream coming from Greg’s room. Heart pounding, he rushed to his son’s room and threw open the door.</p>
                <p>The room was dark and damp, the windows wide open to the raging storm outside. Lightning illuminated the scene intermittently. He tried to flip the light switch, but it wouldn’t work.</p>
                <p>Peering through the darkness, he saw Greg lying in bed. His clothes were drenched in sweat. As another flash of lightning struck, Mr. Paterson froze.</p>
                <p>There, in the bed, was his “son”—but something was horribly wrong. The boy grinned from ear to ear, his giant eyes fixed on him with dilated pupils. His teeth gleamed unnaturally in the flickering light. His expression was inhuman, as if some demonic force had taken over his body.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, Mr. Paterson felt a warm drop slide down his neck. He touched it with his fingertip, and his breath caught in his throat. It was deep, blood-red. Another flash of lightning illuminated the room, and even time itself seemed to stop for this moment, this fear, this reveal.</p>
                <p>He looked up and saw his wife, hanging from the ceiling, tears and blood slowly rolling down her face.</p>
                <p>Mr. Paterson stumbled back, gasping for air. “Who are you!?” he screamed at the figure in the bed.</p>
                <p>The creature smiled wider. “I-I am your ßøn, Dad. Oh, but don’t worry. You’ll be joining Mother very, very soon!”</p>
                <p>No, Mr. Paterson thought,  this is not my son.  It couldn't be… Just then, Mr.Paterson felt like the lightning strikes started to get closer, then closer still.</p>
                <p>The being raised its stiff clawed arm into the air, its voice cracked unnaturally. A bolt of lightning struck the house, and in an instant, the entire house exploded into flames.</p>
                <p>To this day, no one knows who—or what—that demonic creature was. In fact, there’s no concrete evidence the Patersons ever existed. But one thing is certain: the house at 4932, 001 Ave, Raven’s Veil, has never been occupied by a living soul again.</p>
